# Secure-AI-Model-Delivery-Pipeline

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project outlines the implementation of a secure MLOps pipeline that prevents data/model leakage and enforces security gates before deployment.

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Finance sectors face security challenges such as:
- Sensitive data (financial attributes and information) getting leaked.
- Insecure ML code or dependencies.
- Unscanned and unpatched container images.
- Unverified model artifacts.

This project outlines how to embed secure-by-design principles into the ML delivery lifecycle in order to tackle and overcome these security challenges.
